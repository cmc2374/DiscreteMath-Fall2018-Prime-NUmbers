# DiscreteMath-Fall2018-Prime-NUmbers

For Q4 and Q5, the results are done when program is run and shown in tables as text output in the python program. As a result, the values used in those examples are minimized (e.g. prime factorization past 8 digits takes a significantly longer time) so the user does not have to wait too long. When more values are run it becomes clearer for Q4.5 that the graph of Ï€(x) appears to increase in a logarithmic form and for Q5.5 it appeared that the time it takes to calculate the factorization would increase exponentially.

This is the PRIME NUMBER PROJECT

Setup: For the visualization code:

$pip install Pillow
$pip install Matplotlib
$pip install PrettyTable


You might have to uninstall PIL (because Anaconda was moronic in how they installed this)
