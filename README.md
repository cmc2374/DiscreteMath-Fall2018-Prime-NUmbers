# DiscreteMath-Fall2018-Prime-NUmbers


This is the PRIME NUMBER PROJECT
By Chris Calloway and Jennifer Lee


For the Graders:

The relevant code is broken up into the followin files:
Menu.py( which is like bascially the main class) 
Sieve.py
gen_image.py
Primality.py
GCD.py

//Insert Partner's code here:
prime_distribution.py
prime_factorization.py

Non Code:
Report.pdf
This contains some of the answers to the questions posed for the report.


Note:
The menu is a class that has only been tested for Windows devices. If the GUI does not appear
please just run code from their respective files (hence why it was built with this multi-file depedncy
to safegaurd in the case the menu module was Unix Based system incompatible. 
To run prime_distribution.py and have tables show in python, $pip install PrettyTable


Work Division:
Chris did the problems 1,2,3,6,7 and set up this Github repo.
Jennifer did questions 4 and 5. In terms of the diffuculty of the questions, this 
was decided mutally to be as balanced as we could predict before starting. However,
the work was tranpsort and mutally edited by the nature of this public repo.

Chris: 1,2,3,6,7
Jennifer: 4,5







=========================================================================================
For Developers:

Setup: For the visualization code:

$pip install Pillow

You might have to uninstall PIL (because Anaconda was moronic in how they installed this)
